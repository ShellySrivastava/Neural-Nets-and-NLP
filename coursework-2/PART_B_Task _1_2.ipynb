        "Dialogue act (DA) tagging is an important step in the process of developing dialog systems. DA tagging is a problem usually solved by supervised machine learning approaches that all require large amounts of hand labeled data. A wide range of techniques have been investigated for DA tagging. In this lab, we explore two approaches to DA classification. We are using the Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus for training.\n",
